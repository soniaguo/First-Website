<p>my name is sonia guo. i was born in beijing china. i attended preschool in china but moved to canada at the age of 5. i have switched schools 3 times and my first english school 
was southlands. i stayed there only for one year and then moved to queen mary. i also moved houses to somewhere closer to the school. adapting to a new language was hard
but my mom still chose to move me to a late french immersion.</p> 

<p>i have always enjoyed art. i started drawing at a very young age. a few years ago my mom urged me to go to byng for mini arts. i was hesitant but still went. preparing for
the audition was stressful and almost made me sick of painting</p>
